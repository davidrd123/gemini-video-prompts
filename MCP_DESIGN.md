# MCP Layer — Design

**Status:** v1 implemented through Step 8; v2 Option A local async jobs live-smoked
**Author:** David Dickinson + Claude
**Last updated:** 2026-05-09

Wrap the existing `gemini-video-prompts` CLI as an MCP server, and build a separate media-analysis MCP, so Claude Code can invoke generation and evaluation as typed tool calls instead of shelling out to `Bash → uv run`.

## v7 changes from v6

- **Consolidated `media-analysis-mcp` into the existing repo** as a sibling package alongside `gemini_video_prompts_mcp`, instead of a new repo at `~/Projects/LLM/media-analysis-mcp/`. MCP servers are processes registered via console script + `--project` path; the surrounding repo layout is invisible to Claude Code. The "separate repo" justification in v6 ("matches DMPOST31 convention") was a misread — DMPOST31 itself is one repo with multiple MCP subfolders. One repo, multiple `[project.scripts]` entries, multiple sibling packages under `src/` is the right shape for this stage. Reconsider splitting only if (a) a publishable subset emerges or (b) one MCP starts pulling deps the other shouldn't carry.

## v6 changes from v5

- **Demoted 12-file total cap from hard validation error to soft `validation_warning`.** The cap comes from the vault guide (`seedance-prompting-guide.md:23`), not the Replicate schema. Hard-failing a schema-valid request would violate the portability principle — non-Patrick users would hit a wall on a request the provider would accept. Cap still surfaces as a warning so Patrick's workflow gets the signal. A configurable `reference_policy` arg (schema-only vs. production-strict) is deferred to v2; current default is always-warn, never-error.
- **Clarified `check_prompt_references()` uses generated provider tokens** from the references list, not hardcoded `[Image1]` regex. Same code works correctly across Replicate, Fal, or any future provider — no per-provider conditional logic.
- **Broadened `reference_images` signature comment** from "identity/style refs" to "image refs (identity, style, composition)" — Replicate schema describes all three uses.
- **Clarified background prior-art note:** vault guide uses `@Image1` shorthand; Replicate schema uses `[Image1]`. MCP returns provider-truthful tokens — agents using the vault guide as a writing reference paste the bracket form from `references[].token`, not the guide's `@` shorthand.

## v5 changes from v4

- **Fixed reference token syntax** to bracket form (`[Image1]`, `[Video1]`, `[Audio1]`) per Replicate Seedance schema descriptions. Earlier `@Image1` in the return example was inconsistent with the convention paragraph.
- **Provider-truthful tokens.** The `references[].token` field is the provider's actual syntax — Replicate-Seedance returns `[Image1]`; a future Fal adapter returns whatever Fal accepts (likely `@Image1`). No translation across providers; the agent pastes the token verbatim.
- **Fixed mode/exclusivity grouping.** Only `reference_images` is mutually exclusive with `image`/`last_frame_image`. `reference_videos` and `reference_audios` can layer on top of any mode. Signature comments + validation now agree.
- **Added 12-file total reference cap** per `seedance-prompting-guide.md:23` (per-category caps sum to 15 but 12 is the total ceiling; not enforced by Replicate schema, enforced by us).
- **Made Replicate sidecar sanitization explicit** in `seedance.py`. `replicate_min.generate()`'s built-in filter only excludes legacy keys; Seedance handles live under different keys (`last_frame_image`, `reference_images`, etc.) and would leak as file handles into returned JSON without a separate clean-params dict.
- **Defined `dry_run=True` return shape** for both `generate_image` and `generate_video`. Status becomes `"planned"`; `outputs`/`metrics` omitted; `projected_job_dir` provided.

## v4 changes from v3

- **Renamed analysis MCP** from `image-analysis-mcp` to `media-analysis-mcp` — video analysis is first-class per `vault_graffito/open-items.md:51` ("missing link for a fully closed evaluation loop... priority: high").
- **Added video tools:** `describe_video`, `score_video`, `extract_video_frames`. The frame-extraction tool is named in the vault as "the key bottleneck" (`vault_graffito/open-items.md:50`).
- **Split image analysis into two tools:** `describe_image` (Gemini observes, Claude judges) and `score_image` (Gemini judges via 6-dim eval). Same split for video. Lets us A/B which judgment locus produces better real-world iteration.
- **Added `intent` + `context` inputs** to all four describe/score tools. Lets Claude pass conversation-private context (the brief, prior iterations, what specifically to check this round) into Gemini's evaluation.
- **Added three named reference args** (`base_plate_path`, `identity_refs`, `style_refs`) to image/video analysis. Each routes into a distinct dimension prompt.
- **Added `references` map + `mode` discriminator** to `generate_video` return shape — surfaces Seedance's upload-order/role contract per `seedance-prompting-guide.md:31-42`.
- **Added `media_info` (`ffprobe`-derived)** to `generate_video` outputs.
- **Echoed `system_prompt`** in `generate_image` `resolved_params` for completeness.
- **Added Portability Principle** — explicit non-coupling to Patrick's vault markdown shape; tools are usable by any agent / any project.

## Goals

1. **Replace `Bash → uv run gemini-video-prompts ...` with a typed MCP tool call.** Today the agent assembles a long shell command; the MCP shifts the contract to function arguments with default-handling and validation.
2. **Make media evaluation a typed tool call.** Replace the manual "read image, reason about 6 dimensions, write notes" loop. Provide both *describe-only* (Claude judges) and *scored* (Gemini judges) modes so we can A/B which produces better iteration outcomes.
3. **Swap video generation from Veo to Seedance via Replicate (later Fal).** The existing CLI's Veo path is being retired in favor of Seedance.
4. **Stay a thin layer where the layer is genuinely thin, and admit when it isn't.** The image generation tool is plumbing over the existing CLI worker. The video generation tool is a new adapter for a new provider — that's not plumbing, it's adapter code, and the doc should say so. Analysis tools are thin Gemini wrappers with a structured response schema.
5. **Stay portable.** These MCPs are designed for Patrick's vault workflow but also for David's other projects, and for any future user. No vault-specific shapes leak into the tool surface (see Portability Principle below).

## Non-goals

- Not replacing the CLI. It stays as the local entry point for batch runs and dry-runs.
- Not vault-aware. The MCPs do not edit prompt logs, update Approved Keyframes tables, or write `Sent:` markers — that's the agent's job, working from MCP outputs.
- Not multi-provider routing in v1. One backend per modality. Provider abstraction is a v2 problem.
- Not handling the long video-poll problem in v1. Block-and-wait. Async/polling is a v2 decision.

---

## Portability Principle

These MCPs are designed for use by Patrick (GML / Graffito vaults), by David (DMPOST AE workflow, other projects), and by future users with no vault at all. Concrete rules:

- **Field names stay modality-natural**, not vault-natural. `outputs`, `references`, `prompt`, `model` — yes. `Sent`, `ResultNotes`, `NextIteration`, `BreadcrumbEntry` — never.
- **No vault-shape inputs.** No `vault_path`, no `prompts_file`, no `scene_id`. The MCP doesn't know what a vault is.
- **Return JSON, never Markdown.** Logging into a vault is the agent's job; the MCP's job is to return data.
- **Defaults are domain-natural, not project-natural.** The 6-dim eval criteria default comes from the global `generation-review-loop` skill (which any agent can load), not from Patrick's specific vault. The `criteria` arg is fully overridable so non-Patrick users pass their own dimensions.
- **Vault-logging contract is an audit, not a constraint.** The MCP return shape happens to contain everything Patrick's prompt-entry markdown needs (audit at end of doc). It is not *shaped* to match the markdown, and it should not drift toward such shaping in future revisions.

If a future tool or input feels vault-specific, it doesn't belong in these MCPs. Build a separate vault-aware MCP for that.

## Background

### Today's flow

1. Agent constructs a `cd /Users/.../riff-mcp && uv run gemini-video-prompts --prompt "..." --system-prompt "..."` Bash command from project context.
2. Backgrounds it via `run_in_background=true` so the conversation stays responsive.
3. On completion, reads the captured stdout, parses the "saved N output(s) to X" line, and Reads the resulting PNG path.
4. Reasons about the image inline against six named dimensions (`generation-review-loop` SKILL.md), writes a freeform evaluation, surfaces it.

The two friction points are step 1 (long bespoke shell strings) and step 4 (unstructured evaluation that varies per session, with no way to pass conversation-private context into the eval).

### Prior art

- **`riff-mcp/src/gemini_video_prompts/cli.py`** — clean separation between argparse plumbing and `generate_image_job(...)` / `generate_job(...)` workers. The image worker (`cli.py:622-733`) returns a well-shaped result dict and is reusable. **However**, it expects a *fully resolved* job dict (`cli.py:309-375` is the resolver), so the MCP can't call it directly without first reproducing or refactoring that resolver. See §Step 0 below.
- **`/Users/daviddickinson/Projects/LLM/DMPOST31/ae-mcp-dmpost/dmpost-gemini-mcp/server.py`** — FastMCP-based server using the same Python/Gemini stack. Demonstrates `@mcp.tool()` shape, error-code idiom, date-stamped output dirs, and Replicate integration via `vendor/replicate_min.py`. The `nano_segment` tool (`server.py:298-439`) is a working example of a Replicate-backed tool, but it's single-file-input — Seedance needs multi-file. The `nano_analyze_media` tool (`server.py:443-514`) demonstrates Gemini multimodal analysis with video-upload + poll; we lift its `upload_and_poll_video` / `cleanup_uploaded` helpers for `describe_video` / `score_video`.
- **`DMPOST31/.../vendor/replicate_min.py`** — minimal `replicate.run()` wrapper with file-handle lifecycle, sidecar dict, metrics. The lower-level `generate()` (line 107) takes a pure params dict and is the right entry point for Seedance; the higher-level `edit()` (line 173) only handles a single image and is too narrow for our needs.
- **Seedance prompting guide** (`vault_gml/visual/seedance-prompting-guide.md:23-42`) — three named modes (`text_to_video`, `first_last_frames`, `omni_reference`); upload-order reference syntax; explicit role assignment required because "the model does not infer purpose." **Caveat:** the guide uses `@Image1` shorthand throughout, but the Replicate Seedance schema accepts bracket tokens (`[Image1]`). The MCP returns the provider's true syntax; agents using the vault guide as a *writing* reference should paste the bracket form from `references[].token` rather than the guide's `@` shorthand.

## Architecture overview

Two independent MCP servers, each registered in `~/.claude.json` (or per-project `.mcp.json`):

| MCP | Repo | Purpose | Backends |
|-----|------|---------|----------|
| `gemini-prompts-mcp` | sibling package inside `riff-mcp/` | Generate images and videos | Gemini (image), Replicate-Seedance (video) |
| `media-analysis-mcp` | sibling package inside `riff-mcp/` | Describe / score / compare images and videos; extract frames; extract visual tokens | Gemini multimodal (analysis); ffmpeg/ffprobe (frame extraction, media info) |

### Why one MCP for both image + video gen (not split)

- Single responsibility is "generate media." Different providers under the hood is an implementation detail, not a UX boundary.
- Single venv, single `.mcp.json` entry, single restart on dep updates.
- Cost of the extra dep (`replicate`) is trivial — pure Python, no native bits.
- If/when Fal arrives, prefer adding `provider="fal"` arg or a sibling `generate_video_fal` tool over a third MCP.

Reconsider the split if the server file grows beyond ~500 lines or if backend-specific failure modes start polluting the shared code paths.

### Why one MCP for both image + video analysis

- Same Gemini multimodal backend, same response-schema pattern, same six default criteria.
- Frame extraction is conceptually a media-inspection tool — fits the same MCP even though it's ffmpeg-driven, not Gemini-driven. Tiny tool (~30 lines); not worth splitting until more transformation tools accumulate.
- Vault open-items name analysis + frame extraction as a single workflow ("the missing link in the loop: generate → review → extract frame → iterate" — `vault_graffito/open-items.md:51`).

```

**Why main deps, not extras.** Putting `mcp[cli]` and `replicate` behind `[project.optional-dependencies]` would mean `pip install -e .` produces a `gemini-prompts-mcp` console script that crashes on first import. Both packages are pure-Python and small (~5MB combined). The dep boundary purity isn't worth the broken-on-default-install footgun.

### Step 0 — Refactor `cli.py`

**Why.** `generate_image_job(...)` (`cli.py:622`) takes a fully *resolved* job dict — meaning batch_path, source_index, source_format, and the merged-defaults+overrides+job key set. That resolution lives in `resolved_job()` (`cli.py:309-375`), which presupposes a CLI-shaped input (defaults dict, cli_overrides dict, batch source). For the MCP to call the worker, it would have to fake all four — or we extract the actual logic.

**Action.** Add `build_resolved_image_job()` to `cli.py`:

```python
def build_resolved_image_job(
    *,
    prompt: str,
    title: Optional[str] = None,
    model: Optional[str] = None,
    system_prompt: Optional[str] = None,
    image: Optional[str] = None,
    images: Optional[list[str]] = None,
    aspect_ratio: Optional[str] = None,
    image_size: Optional[str] = None,
    temperature: Optional[float] = None,
    num_outputs: int = 1,
    out_root: Optional[str] = None,
    base_dir: Optional[Path] = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Build a resolved image-mode job dict from inline parameters.

    Used by both the CLI inline-mode (--prompt) branch and the MCP generate_image tool.
    Mirrors the shape produced by resolved_job() for image-mode jobs.
    """
    ...
```

The CLI inline branch (`cli.py:826-841` + `resolved_job` call at 861) collapses to a single call into this helper. The MCP `generate_image` calls the same helper. One source of truth.

**Optional.** Same treatment for the video path is *not* needed in v1 — Veo's `generate_job()` is being retired. The new Seedance path is its own adapter (see below) and never touches the CLI's video resolver.

### Tools

#### `generate_image` (Gemini)

```python
def generate_image(
    prompt: str,
    system_prompt: Optional[str] = None,
    model: str = "gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
    image: Optional[str] = None,                # single ref image path
    images: Optional[List[str]] = None,         # multiple ref image paths
    aspect_ratio: Optional[str] = None,         # "16:9", "9:16", "1:1", "3:4", ...
    image_size: Optional[str] = None,           # "1K", "2K", ...
    temperature: Optional[float] = None,         # opt-in sampling override
    num_outputs: int = 1,                       # 1..4
    title: Optional[str] = None,
    out_root: Optional[str] = None,             # default: <repo>/out
    dry_run: bool = False,                      # if True, return resolved job without firing
) -> dict
```

**Implementation.** With `build_resolved_image_job()` extracted, this is genuinely thin:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def generate_image(...) -> dict:
    job = build_resolved_image_job(prompt=prompt, model=model, system_prompt=system_prompt, ...)
    if dry_run:
        return summarize_job(1, job)
    client, gtypes = init_client()
    day_dir = ensure_dir(Path(job["out_root"]) / dt.date.today().isoformat())
    return generate_image_job(client=client, gtypes=gtypes, batch_path=...,
                              job=job, run_day_dir=day_dir)
```

Returns the result dict from `generate_image_job` verbatim — with `system_prompt` echoed in `resolved_params` so vault-logging callers can record it without re-deriving:

```jsonc
{
  "status": "ok",
  "created_at": "2026-05-08T...",
  "title": "sc04-v13-wide-establishing",
  "model": "gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
  "prompt": "...",
  "resolved_params": {
    "system_prompt": "...",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "image_size": null,
    "temperature": null,
    "num_outputs": 1,
    "image": null,
    "images": null
  },
  "input_count": 0,
  "inputs": [],
  "attempts": 1,
  "text": null,
  "job_dir": "/Users/.../out/2026-05-08/gemini-3-pro-image-preview/01_<title>_<hash>",
  "outputs": [
    { "index": 1, "path": "<job_dir>/<title>_01.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720 }
  ]
}
```

#### `generate_video` (Seedance via Replicate) — new adapter

This is **not a wrapper around `cli.py:generate_job`.** Veo and Seedance share neither parameter shape nor output handling. The video tool is a new Seedance-specific adapter living in `gemini_video_prompts_mcp/seedance.py`.

**Signature** (matching the Seedance 2.0 Replicate input schema, with mutual-exclusivity validated at tool entry):

```python
def generate_video(
    prompt: str,
    model: str = "bytedance/seedance-2.0",
    # First/last-frame inputs (mutually exclusive with reference_images)
    image: Optional[str] = None,                    # first frame
    last_frame_image: Optional[str] = None,         # last frame; requires image
    # Image references — identity, style, or composition (mutually exclusive with image/last_frame_image)
    reference_images: Optional[List[str]] = None,   # ≤9, prompt tokens [Image1]..[Image9]
    # Motion/audio references (layerable on either mode above; not mutually exclusive)
    reference_videos: Optional[List[str]] = None,   # ≤3, total ≤15s, [Video1]..[Video3]
    reference_audios: Optional[List[str]] = None,   # ≤3, total ≤15s, [Audio1]..[Audio3]
    # Output controls
    duration: int = 5,                              # 4..15, or -1 for "intelligent"
    resolution: str = "720p",                       # "480p" | "720p" | "1080p"
    aspect_ratio: str = "16:9",                     # "16:9"|"4:3"|"1:1"|"3:4"|"9:16"|"21:9"|"9:21"|"adaptive"
    generate_audio: bool = False,                   # NB: schema default true; we override to false
    seed: Optional[int] = None,
    title: Optional[str] = None,
    out_root: Optional[str] = None,
    timeout_s: int = 600,
    dry_run: bool = False,
) -> dict
```

**Validation at tool entry** (raise `INVALID_INPUT: <message>`):

- `image` or `last_frame_image` set AND any of `reference_images` set → mutually exclusive per schema
- `last_frame_image` set without `image` → "last_frame_image requires a first frame"
- `len(reference_images) > 9`, `len(reference_videos) > 3`, `len(reference_audios) > 3` → per-type cap exceeded (schema-enforced)
- `duration` not in `{-1, 4..15}` → out of range
- `reference_audios` set but no `image`/`reference_images`/`reference_videos` → schema requires anchor
- `resolution` not in `{"480p","720p","1080p"}` → invalid
- `aspect_ratio` not in the schema enum → invalid

Strictness here is deliberate: Replicate rejects invalid combos with opaque API errors. We want a clean MCP error code instead.

**Soft warnings (non-blocking, surface in `validation_warnings[]`):**

- `len(reference_images) + len(reference_videos) + len(reference_audios) > 12` — total reference cap from the vault guide (`seedance-prompting-guide.md:23`); per-type caps sum to 15 (9+3+3), but 12 is the working ceiling in production. Replicate's schema does not enforce this, so we don't either — but Patrick's workflow gets the signal.
- Any uploaded reference slot whose `token` does not appear in the prompt text — Seedance won't know what role to assign it.

Soft-warning checks live in `seedance.py` and never block firing. A future `reference_policy="production"` arg could promote selected warnings to errors, but v1 is always-warn-never-error to keep portability beyond Patrick's vault.

**Why `generate_audio=False` default vs. schema's `True`.** Production usage tends to replace gen-audio with edited score in post; firing every job with audio wastes time and credits. Override on the call when audio is wanted.

**Reference token convention.** Seedance correlates prompt mentions to inputs via `[Image1]..[Image9]`, `[Video1]..[Video3]`, `[Audio1]..[Audio3]`. The agent uses the `seedance-prompting` skill to write the prompt; the MCP tool just passes the array order through. The return shape includes a soft validation warning if any uploaded slot is not named in prompt text.

**Provider-truthful tokens.** The `references[].token` field is the provider's actual syntax — Replicate-Seedance returns bracket form (`[Image1]`); a future Fal adapter would return whatever Fal accepts (likely `@Image1`). The agent reads `token` and pastes it into the prompt — never translates between providers. The `role` field stays provider-agnostic (`FIRST_FRAME`, `LAST_FRAME`, `REFERENCE_IMAGE`, `REFERENCE_VIDEO`, `REFERENCE_AUDIO`).

**Implementation outline.** `seedance.py`:

```python
def build_seedance_video_params(
    *, prompt, image, last_frame_image, reference_images, reference_videos,
    reference_audios, duration, resolution, aspect_ratio, generate_audio, seed,
) -> dict:
    """Pure function: validate inputs, return Replicate-shaped params dict.
    No I/O. Easily unit-testable."""
    ...

def derive_mode(*, image, last_frame_image, reference_images, reference_videos, reference_audios) -> str:
    """Returns one of 'text_to_video', 'first_last_frames', 'omni_reference' per
    seedance-prompting-guide.md:25."""
    ...

def build_references_map(...) -> list[dict]:
    """[{token, path, role}] in upload order. Roles: FIRST_FRAME, LAST_FRAME,
    REFERENCE_IMAGE, REFERENCE_VIDEO, REFERENCE_AUDIO."""
    ...

def check_prompt_references(prompt: str, references: list[dict]) -> list[str]:
    """Soft check: for each {token, path, role} in `references`, scan `prompt`
    for that exact provider token (e.g. "[Image1]" for Replicate-Seedance,

    whose token does not appear in the prompt text.

    Crucially uses tokens FROM the references list — never hardcoded bracket
    or @-syntax — so the same code stays correct across providers."""
    ...

def check_total_reference_cap(references: list[dict]) -> list[str]:
    """Soft check: warn if total references > 12 (vault working ceiling per
    seedance-prompting-guide.md:23). Per-type caps are schema-enforced
    elsewhere as hard errors."""
    ...

def run_seedance_job(
    *, api_params, return_params, image_path, last_frame_path,
    ref_image_paths, ref_video_paths, ref_audio_paths,
    out_dir, base_name, timeout_s,
) -> dict:
    """Build api_params (with file handles for image/last_frame_image/
    reference_images/reference_videos/reference_audios), call
    replicate_min.generate(), then replace the sidecar's `inputs` and
    `resolved_params` with `return_params` (string paths only — never file
    handles). Owns the file-handle lifecycle (try/finally close on every
    handle).

    Why explicit sanitization is required: replicate_min.generate()'s built-in
    filter (replicate_min.py:160-161) only excludes legacy keys (image,
    image_input, input_images). Seedance handles live under last_frame_image,
    reference_images, reference_videos, reference_audios — those would leak as
    file handles into returned JSON without this step."""
    ...
```

The `replicate_min.py` borrowed from DMPOST31 is *only* extended in one place: `_ext_from_url()` line 73 — add `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.webm` to the allowed-extensions set. Otherwise it stays pristine for parity with DMPOST31.

**Return shape** (normalized to mirror `generate_image`, plus video-specific fields):

}
```

`media_info` is probed via `ffprobe` after download. `ffprobe` is a system dep — same as MCP #2's frame-extraction tool, so no new install pain.

**`dry_run=True` return shape.** When `dry_run=True`, no API call fires, no file handles open, no output writes. Status becomes `"planned"`; `outputs`/`metrics`/`created_at`/`model_version` are omitted; `projected_job_dir` is the path that *would* be created on a real run:

```jsonc
{
  "status": "planned",
  "title": "...",
  "model": "bytedance/seedance-2.0",
  "mode": "first_last_frames",
  "prompt": "...",
  "resolved_params": {

  ],
  "validation_warnings": [],
  "projected_job_dir": "/Users/.../out/2026-05-08/bytedance-seedance-2.0/01_<title>_<hash>"
}
```

`generate_image` `dry_run=True` returns the resolved job summary from the existing CLI helper `summarize_job()` (`cli.py:402-423`) plus `status: "planned"` and `projected_job_dir`. Same shape contract: API call suppressed, paths projected, no file writes.

### Borrow map

| What | From | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| FastMCP scaffold + `mcp.run()` | `dmpost-gemini-mcp/server.py:25, 53, 517-518` | Copy verbatim |
| `_slugify`, `_prompt_stem` | `cli.py:30-45` | Import from `gemini_video_prompts.cli` |
| Output date-dir helpers (`_output_date_dir`, `_next_seq`) | `server.py:144-164` | Copy, retarget base from `~/Documents/dmpost-ae-mcp/generated/` to the existing `out/` convention |
| SDK version guard (`_google_genai_version`, `_supports_image_config`, `_require_image_config_support`) | `server.py:56-76` | Copy as-is |
| Error-code idiom: `raise RuntimeError("CODE: msg")` with codes like `IMAGE_NOT_FOUND`, `NO_IMAGE_RETURNED`, `OUTPUT_WRITE_FAILED`, `REPLICATE_ERROR`, `IMAGE_CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED`, `INVALID_INPUT`, `FFPROBE_FAILED` | `server.py` throughout | Adopt convention; add codes as new failure modes appear |
| `replicate_min.generate()` (lower-level entry — pure params, no implicit single-image handling) | `vendor/replicate_min.py:107-170` | Use as the call site for Seedance. Do **not** use `edit()` (single-file only). |
| `replicate_min._write_outputs` and `_ext_from_url` | `vendor/replicate_min.py:65-104` | Copy verbatim, edit one line: extend `_ext_from_url` allowed-set with `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.webm` (currently line 73) |

| **New code (no borrow):** Seedance adapter — param validation, multi-file handle lifecycle, mode derivation, references map, prompt-text check | `gemini_video_prompts_mcp/seedance.py` | ~150 lines, owns its own correctness |
| **Drop:** WSL/Windows path normalization (`_windows_to_wsl`, `_wsl_to_windows`, `_resolve_path`, `_discover_base_dir`) | `server.py:97-142` | Mac-only, no AE bridge |
| **Drop:** `nano_segment` (SAM3) and `nano_analyze_media` (Gemini media analysis) tools | `server.py:298-514` | Out of scope for this MCP; analysis lives in MCP #2 |
| **Drop:** `replicate_min.edit()` | `vendor/replicate_min.py:173-223` | Single-file only; Seedance needs multi-file. Use `generate()` directly. |

### Configuration

Reads from environment (with `.env` fallback via `python-dotenv`, already loaded by `cli.py:62-68`):

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — required
- `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` — required when `generate_video` is called
- `GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL` — optional default override (already honored by `cli.py:339`)

`GEMINI_VIDEO_MODEL` is no longer consulted (Veo retired); Seedance model_ref is `bytedance/seedance-2.0` constant unless overridden via the tool's `model` arg.

System dep: `ffprobe` (typically installed alongside `ffmpeg` — `brew install ffmpeg` on Mac).

### Tools

| Tool | Default model | Purpose | Who judges? |
|------|---------------|---------|-------------|
| `describe_image` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | Rich structured observations of one image; no scores | **Claude** — consumes the description, applies the rubric herself |
| `score_image` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | 6-dim scored eval of one image; advisory `decision_hint` | **Gemini** — Claude can override |
| `describe_video` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | Rich structured observations of one video; video-aware fields | **Claude** |
| `score_video` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | 6-dim scored eval of one video, dims adapted per skill SKILL.md:290-300 | **Gemini** |
| `analyze_videos` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | Free-form cross-video question over 2–10 ordered, labeled videos | **Claude** |
| `analyze_audio` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | Free-form auditory analysis or transcription of one recording | **Claude** |
| `compare_images` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | "Which is better"; pick + reasoning | **Gemini** |
| `extract_visual_tokens` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | Categorized token deconstruct for env-coverage genesis workflow | **Gemini (descriptive)** |
| `extract_video_frames` | — (no model) | ffmpeg subprocess; timestamp → PNG list | — |

**Why both `describe` and `score`.** `describe_image` lets Claude do the judgment using conversation-private context. `score_image` lets Gemini do the judgment when Claude wants a fast structured verdict. They wrap the same Gemini call internally — only the system instruction + response schema differs. A/B testing which produces better real-world iteration outcomes is the empirical question this design supports.

**Why option (a) — no `analyze_image` wrapper.** Naming forces the choice between describe and score, and the choice is meaningful. A wrapper that picks for you (or accepts a `mode` arg) hides what's actually happening.

### Common inputs across describe/score tools

All four tools (`describe_image`, `score_image`, `describe_video`, `score_video`) accept:

```python
prompt: str                           # the gen prompt (what the gen model was asked to do)
intent: Optional[str] = None          # the brief — what this generation was trying to solve
context: Optional[str] = None         # case-specific freeform notes — prior iterations, what to focus on this round
base_plate_path: Optional[str] = None # for preservation_fidelity (mutation eval)
identity_refs: Optional[List[str]] = None   # for identity carry-through eval
style_refs: Optional[List[str]] = None      # for style_lock comparison
model: str = "gemini-3.7-flash"
temperature: Optional[float] = None         # opt-in sampling override
system_prompt: Optional[str] = None         # rare override for model behavior
```

**Why `intent` and `context` are split (not one freeform field):**

- `intent` is durable — Claude probably has it once and reuses it across many calls on related shots.
- `context` is per-call, ephemeral — "this is iteration 4, prior failed on X, check whether Y was fixed."
- They route into different parts of the eval template: `intent` feeds Creative Brief Fidelity (dim 6); `context` directs attention to the specific dimension being checked this iteration.

**Why three named ref args (not one `references` list):**

- Each routes into a distinct part of the eval template. `base_plate_path` triggers the preservation-fidelity sub-prompt; `identity_refs` trigger identity-carry sub-prompts; `style_refs` trigger a style-lock comparison.
- Discoverability: an agent picking the tool sees three named args and knows which to populate per use case.
- Trade-off: less generic than a flat list, but covers the vault use cases (`vault_gml/CLAUDE.md:162, 166`) and is easy to extend.

### `describe_image`

Input: common inputs + `image_path: str`.

Returns:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "gemini-3.7-flash",
  "image_path": "/path/to/image.png",
  "observations": {
    "composition": "Wide isometric establishing shot. Central machine dominates the frame; supermarket facade in background. Cars arranged in tidy rows along the left and right edges; the foreground asphalt is mostly empty.",
    "subject_elements": "...",
    "color_and_palette": "...",
    "style_and_rendering": "...",
    "lighting_and_atmosphere": "...",
    "text_and_signage": "...",
    "notable_or_unexpected": "...",
    "artifacts_or_failures": "..."
  },
  "freeform_observations": "Optional model-driven prose — anything that didn't fit the structured fields.",
  "context_used": {
    "prompt": "...",
    "intent": "...",
    "context": "...",
    "base_plate_path": null,
    "identity_refs": [],
    "style_refs": []
  }
}
```

Eight fixed observation categories — predictable for the agent to consume. `freeform_observations` catches anything off-taxonomy. `context_used` echoes inputs so the agent can audit what the eval had to work with.

### `score_image`

Input: common inputs + `image_path: str` + `criteria: Optional[List[str]] = None` (default = SIX_DIMENSIONS from `~/.claude/skills/generation-review-loop/SKILL.md:74-131`).

Returns:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "gemini-3.7-flash",
  "image_path": "/path/to/image.png",
  "evaluations": {
    "prompt_fidelity":         { "score": 75, "notes": "Wide lot ✓, machine ✓..." },
    "preservation_fidelity":   { "score": null, "notes": "N/A — Genesis t2i" },
    "style_lock":              { "score": 80, "notes": "..." },
    "scene_hierarchy":         { "score": 90, "notes": "..." },
    "story_service":           { "score": 80, "notes": "..." },
    "creative_brief_fidelity": { "score": 70, "notes": "..." }
  },
  "summary": "~80% pass. Direction Gate trigger: time-of-day register drift.",
  "decision_hint": "direction_gate",
  "context_used": { "...": "same shape as describe_image" }
}
```

`decision_hint` is one of `accept`, `iterate`, `reroll`, `direction_gate` — derived from dimension scores via the decision tree at `generation-review-loop/SKILL.md:135-155`. **Treat as the model's vote, not a verdict.** The agent has final say. We expect drift before calibration.

### `describe_video` / `score_video`

Same shapes as image versions, plus video-specific observation fields:

- `describe_video.observations` adds: `motion_and_camera`, `pacing_and_timing`, `frame_continuity`, `audio_quality` (when audio present).
- `score_video.evaluations` uses the same six dim names but with video-adapted prompt language per `generation-review-loop/SKILL.md:290-300`.

Implementation: video upload via Gemini Files API + poll, lifted from `dmpost-gemini-mcp/server.py:481-494` (`upload_and_poll_video`, `cleanup_uploaded`). Wrapped in `gemini_media.py` so the tool functions stay clean.

### `compare_images`

```python
def compare_images(
    image_paths: List[str],
    prompt: str,
    intent: Optional[str] = None,
    context: Optional[str] = None,
    criteria: Optional[List[str]] = None,
    model: str = "gemini-3.7-flash",
) -> dict
```

Returns:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "...",
  "image_paths": ["..."],
  "comparison": "Image 1 holds style lock better; image 2 has stronger composition...",
  "pick": { "best_index": 1, "best_path": "...", "reasoning": "..." }
}
```

### `extract_visual_tokens`

```python
def extract_visual_tokens(
    image_path: str,
    categories: Optional[List[str]] = None,    # default: TOKEN_CATEGORIES
    intent: Optional[str] = None,              # focuses the extraction
    model: str = "gemini-3.7-flash",
) -> dict
```

Default categories (from `vault_gml/CLAUDE.md:164` env-coverage workflow):

```python
TOKEN_CATEGORIES = ["lighting", "atmosphere", "palette", "materials", "spatial_grammar"]
```

Returns:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "gemini-3.7-flash",
  "image_path": "/path/to/image.png",
  "tokens": {
    "lighting":        ["high-key commercial", "warm key light", "no cast shadows"],
    "atmosphere":      ["pristine", "midday", "no haze"],
    "palette":         ["candy pink", "electric mint", "warm cream"],
    "materials":       ["glossy lacquer", "matte fabric"],
    "spatial_grammar": ["isometric 3/4", "flat horizontal plane"]
  }
}
```

These tokens drop directly into the genesis-prompt-from-tokens workflow.

### `extract_video_frames`

```python
def extract_video_frames(
    video_path: str,
    timestamps: List[Union[float, str]],   # seconds (5.5) or HH:MM:SS strings
    out_dir: Optional[str] = None,         # default: <video_dir>/frames/
    title_prefix: Optional[str] = None,    # default: <video_basename>
) -> dict
```

ffmpeg subprocess per timestamp: `ffmpeg -ss <ts> -i <video> -frames:v 1 -q:v 1 <out>`.

Returns:

```jsonc
{
  "video_path": "/abs/path/clip.mp4",
  "frame_count": 3,
  "frames": [
    { "timestamp_s": 0.0,  "path": "/.../clip_t0.000.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720 },
    { "timestamp_s": 2.5,  "path": "/.../clip_t2.500.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720 },
    { "timestamp_s": 4.99, "path": "/.../clip_t4.990.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720 }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — required
- No Replicate dep — Gemini-only
- System deps: `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe`

### Implementation notes

- **Use Gemini `response_schema`** (Pydantic class) to force JSON conformance for describe/score/extract tools. Falls back to tolerant text parsing only on schema-rejection errors.
- **Image loading:** Pillow `Image.open(path).convert("RGB")` (matches both `cli.py:101` and `server.py:478`).
- **Video upload:** `client.files.upload(...)` + poll until `state == "ACTIVE"`, then pass as `gtypes.FileData(file_uri=..., mime_type=...)`. Always `cleanup_uploaded()` in `finally`.
- **Prompt templates:** one shared template per mode in `prompts.py`. Each template interpolates `{intent}`, `{context}`, `{prompt}`, the criterion list (for score), and reference role descriptions (for ref-aware tools).

---

## A/B comparison plan

The describe/score split exists because we don't yet know which produces better real-world iteration. The doc supports the experiment but doesn't prejudge it.

Once both modes are live, three comparisons:

| Comparison | Setup | Measures |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **Cold A/B** | Both modes, no `intent`/`context` | Raw model judgment quality |
| **Briefed A/B** | Both modes, `intent`+`context` populated | Model judgment with Claude's context |
| **Cross A/B** | Per-job: which mode produced the better next-iteration prompt? | Real-world workflow win-rate |

The empirical question: does briefed describe-mode produce text rich enough that Claude's downstream judgment dominates anyway? Does briefed score-mode become accurate enough to trust directly? Both are possible; only running tells.

Tracking method: log MCP calls to a side-file with `mode`, `decision_hint` (when score-mode), and the agent's actual next action. Manual review every 20 calls.

## Sequencing

| # | Step | Verify by |
|---|------|-----------|
| 0 | Refactor `cli.py`: extract `build_resolved_image_job()`. CLI inline-mode branch (`cli.py:826-869`) collapses to a single helper call. | **Done.** Existing CLI inline path and MCP image generation share the helper. |
| 1 | Scaffold MCP #1 package; `pyproject.toml` updates per the diff above. | **Done.** `gemini-prompts-mcp` console script is registered. |
| 2 | Implement `generate_image` (Gemini path). | **Done.** Reuses the resolved image worker path. |
| 3 | Copy `replicate_min.py`, edit `_ext_from_url`. Implement `seedance.py` (`build_seedance_video_params`, `derive_mode`, `build_references_map`, `check_prompt_references`, `run_seedance_job`). Implement `generate_video` calling into `seedance.py`. Add `ffprobe` `media_info` probe. | **Done.** Unit coverage exercises dry-run modes, validation, coded errors, sidecar writing, and cold-start metrics. |
| 4 | Scaffold MCP #2 as a sibling package at `src/media_analysis_mcp/` inside the existing repo. Add `pydantic` to deps and `media-analysis-mcp` console script + Hatch packaging. | **Done.** `media-analysis-mcp` console script is registered. |
| 5 | Implement `gemini_media.py` (image load, video upload+poll). Implement `prompts.py` (describe / score / token templates). Implement `describe_image` and `score_image` with default criteria. | **Done.** Unit coverage exercises image describe/score contract and schema-mismatch rejection. |
| 6 | Implement `describe_video` and `score_video`. | **Done.** |
| 7 | Implement `ffmpeg_utils.py` and `extract_video_frames`. | **Done.** |
| 8 | Implement `compare_images` and `extract_visual_tokens`. | **Done.** |

Step 0 was the critical unlock: without it, Step 2 would have had to fake CLI internals. With Step 8 complete, this table now records the v1 implementation boundary rather than an active build queue.

## Future / v2

V2 should be scoped as a set of separable tracks. They do not all need to ship together.

### Option A: Local Async Jobs

Baseline v2 candidate.

Implementation status: initial local async surface is implemented,
mock-verified, and live-smoked (`start_video_job`, `get_video_job`,
`cancel_video_job`). It uses durable local `request.json` / `status.json` files,
non-blocking Replicate prediction creation, and terminal-success output
download. The provenance extension adds normalized requested/effective seed
tracking, SHA-256 identities from the opened upload streams and downloaded
outputs, an append-only `index.ndjson` with a shared write lock and recoverable
per-job event markers, locked terminal finalization, and read-only
`get_generation` / `list_generations` lookups that also discover records
created before the index.

Generation timestamps distinguish lifecycle events: `created_at` is the local
request/submission time, provider `started_at` / `completed_at` values are
preserved when available, and `collected_at` records when the local result and
downloaded artifacts were finalized.

Add:
- `start_video_job(...)` - creates the Replicate prediction and returns `{job_id, prediction_id, status, job_dir}` immediately.
- `get_video_job(job_id)` - reads local `status.json` / `job.json`, then optionally polls Replicate by `prediction_id`.
- `cancel_video_job(job_id)` - cancels the provider prediction if still running.
- `get_generation(job_id)` - bundles the immutable request, latest status, final
  result, record paths, and seed provenance without polling.
- `list_generations(...)` - searches indexed and historical local job records.
- A local jobs directory under the existing output root, with `status.json` as the durable coordination point.
- Keep blocking `generate_video(...)` as a convenience wrapper around start + wait.

Pros:
- Solves long blocking MCP calls without requiring an HTTP server, public endpoint, or tunnel.
- Works for local Codex / Claude Code usage.
- Keeps the v1 return shape mostly intact.

Cons:
- Still polling-based.
- Requires a non-blocking Replicate prediction-create helper alongside the current blocking `replicate_min.generate()` / `replicate.run(...)` path.

### Option B: Webhook Completion

Async jobs with provider-driven completion.

Add:
- Optional `webhook_url` arg to `start_video_job(...)`.
- `webhook_events_filter=["completed"]` when creating the Replicate prediction.
- A separate HTTP receiver process or app endpoint; stdio MCP itself should not receive webhooks.
- Replicate signature verification.
- Idempotent completion handling for duplicate or out-of-order deliveries.
- Immediate output download before provider URLs expire.

Pros:
- Best long-job behavior for unattended runs.
- Reduces polling and catches completed jobs even if the MCP client is not actively waiting.

Cons:
- Requires a public HTTPS endpoint. Local dev needs Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or equivalent.
- Adds operational surface area and webhook security requirements.

Recommended stance: design for it in v2, but make local polling the required path and webhooks optional.

### Option C: Closed Riff Loop

Move from typed tools to a durable generate -> analyze -> choose -> iterate loop without becoming vault-specific.

Add:
- `compare_videos(...)`, parallel to `compare_images`.
- JSONL audit trail keyed by `run_id` / `iteration_id`.
- Generic lineage fields: prompt, references, outputs, scores, selected candidate, extracted visual tokens, next-prompt inputs.
- Optional A/B telemetry for `describe_*` vs. `score_*`, replacing manual side-file notes.

Pros:
- Highest workflow value; this is the actual riff loop.
- Gives us data on whether describe-mode or score-mode produces better next actions.

Cons:
- Return shapes need discipline so they stay portable and do not drift into vault-specific logging.

### Option D: Provider Expansion

Introduce video provider choice once a second provider is real.

Possible shapes:
- `provider="replicate" | "fal"` on `generate_video` / `start_video_job`.
- Or sibling tools such as `generate_video_replicate(...)` and `generate_video_fal(...)`.
- Or provider modules under a common internal interface while keeping the MCP tool surface stable.

Pros:
- Makes Fal or another video backend possible without rewriting callers.

Cons:
- Premature until Fal is actually used. With only one backend, a provider abstraction is mostly fake architecture.

Recommended stance: defer beyond v2.0 unless a second provider becomes an active requirement.

### Option E: After Effects / Mac Bridge

Keep AE control out of `riff-mcp`.

Boundary:
- `riff-mcp` generates, analyzes, compares, and selects media.
- A separate AE-specific MCP imports selected assets, places them in comps, updates layers, and renders previews.
- `riff-mcp` should make this easier by returning better asset metadata: width, height, duration, fps, alpha/audio flags, model, prompt lineage, and selected candidate IDs.

Pros:
- Preserves portability.
- Keeps Mac-only AE automation separate from media generation/evaluation.

Cons:
- Requires a second MCP and AE-specific scripting/automation work.

### Recommended Sequence

V2.0:
- Local async jobs: `start_video_job`, `get_video_job`, optional `cancel_video_job`. Initial implementation is in place and live-smoked.
- Durable local job status files. Initial implementation is in place.
- Blocking `generate_video` preserved as a wrapper.
- `compare_videos`.
- JSONL iteration audit.
- `.mcp.example.json` and a `doctor` command for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, imports, and writable output root.

V2.1:
- Optional webhook receiver path.
- Replicate signature verification.
- Completed-job output download and idempotent status updates.

V2.2:
- Provider abstraction only if Fal or another provider is actually in use.

Separate track:
- AE/Mac bridge MCP that consumes `riff-mcp` outputs instead of living inside this repo.

Deferred from v1/v2 unless specifically needed:
- Standalone `plan_job` tool; `dry_run` covers the current use case.
- Streaming results for long analysis outputs.
- Vault-aware tools such as `log_prompt_entry` or `mark_keyframe_approved`; those violate this repo's Portability Principle and belong in a separate vault-aware MCP.
- `structured_intent`; freeform `intent` and `context` remain more flexible until repeated patterns emerge.
- `reference_policy: Literal["schema", "production"]`; add when a workflow actively wants selected warnings promoted to hard errors.

## Schema reference — Seedance 2.0 (Replicate)

Captured 2026-05-08 from `bytedance/seedance-2.0` Replicate input schema. Source of truth for the `generate_video` tool signature.

**Required:** `prompt`

**Mutually exclusive groups:**
- Group A: `image`, `last_frame_image` (`last_frame_image` requires `image`)
- Group B: `reference_images`
- A and B cannot both be set.

**Anchored requirement:** `reference_audios` requires at least one of `image` / `reference_images` / `reference_videos`.

**Total cap (vault, not schema):** `len(reference_images) + len(reference_videos) + len(reference_audios) ≤ 12` per `seedance-prompting-guide.md:23`. Per-type caps sum to 15 (9+3+3); 12 is the working ceiling. Replicate's schema does not enforce this — we surface it as a soft `validation_warning`, never a hard error, to keep portability beyond Patrick's vault.

**Field summary:**

| Field | Type | Constraints | Default |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| `prompt` | string | required | — |
| `seed` | int? | nullable | null |
| `image` | uri? | first frame; mut.ex. with `reference_images` | null |
| `last_frame_image` | uri? | requires `image`; mut.ex. with `reference_images` | null |
| `reference_images` | uri[] | ≤9; mut.ex. with `image`/`last_frame_image`; correlated as `[Image1]..[Image9]` | `[]` |
| `reference_videos` | uri[] | ≤3, total ≤15s; correlated as `[Video1]..[Video3]` | `[]` |
| `reference_audios` | uri[] | ≤3, total ≤15s; needs anchor; `[Audio1]..[Audio3]` | `[]` |
| `duration` | int | -1 or 4..15 (-1 = "intelligent") | 5 |
| `resolution` | enum | `480p` / `720p` / `1080p` | `720p` |
| `aspect_ratio` | enum | `16:9`/`4:3`/`1:1`/`3:4`/`9:16`/`21:9`/`9:21`/`adaptive` | `16:9` |
| `generate_audio` | bool | dialogue (double-quoted in prompt) + SFX + music | **`true`** (we override to `false`) |

## Vault-logging contract — audit, not constraint

For Patrick's GML/Graffito vaults specifically, the agent logs each generation into a Markdown prompt-entry. This audit confirms the MCP return shapes contain everything that workflow needs — **without coupling MCP design to the markdown shape**. Any field not in the list below either (a) is generic enough to map cleanly anyway, or (b) belongs in the vault's own metadata/notes rather than the MCP return.

| Vault prompt-entry field | image return path | video return path |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Date / Sent | `created_at` | `created_at` |
| Source plate / refs | `inputs[]` | `references[]` |
| Model | `model` | `model` |
| System instruction | `resolved_params.system_prompt` | N/A (Seedance) |
| Job addenda | (text in prompt; agent's responsibility) | (same) |
| Prompt | `prompt` | `prompt` |
| Output path | `outputs[].path` | `outputs[].path` |
| Dimensions | `outputs[].{width, height}` | `outputs[].media_info.{width, height}` |
| Duration | N/A | `outputs[].media_info.duration_s` |
| FPS | N/A | `outputs[].media_info.fps` |
| Has audio | N/A | `outputs[].media_info.has_audio` |
| Seed | (Gemini doesn't expose) | `resolved_params.seed` |
| Generation timing | (Gemini doesn't expose) | `metrics.predict_time_s` |
| Mode | N/A | `mode` |
| Validation warnings | N/A | `validation_warnings[]` |

This audit informs *what fields the MCP returns* but does not *shape the field names*. Field naming is modality-natural per Portability Principle.
